# MovieTicketBookingSystem

This project is a Java-based console application for booking movie tickets.
It demonstrates core Java concepts (OOP, collections, and exception handling) and JDBC integration for interacting with a database.

Users can:

1.View a list of movies

2.Check available showtimes for a movie

3.View and book available seats for a selected show

4.It follows a DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern for clean database interaction.

🚀 Getting Started:
--------------------
This project can be run directly on any Java environment with database connectivity configured.

Steps Overview:

1. Clone or download the project source files.


2. Configure your database (tables: Movies, Shows, Seats, Bookings).


3. Update database connection details in your DAO classes.


4. Compile and run the Main.java file.

🧱 Prerequisites:
-----------------
Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

Requirement	Version/Tools:
--------------------------
✓ Java JDK	8 or above
✓ Database	MySQL / Oracle / PostgreSQL
✓ JDBC Driver	Corresponding to your database
✓ IDE (Optional)	Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
✓ Maven (Optional)	For managing dependencies


Database Tables Required:
-------------------------
✓ Movies

✓ Showtimes

✓Seats

✓ Bookings



---

⚙️ Installation Steps:
-----------------------

1. Clone or Download the repository:

2. Import Project into your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ).

3. Configure Database Connection inside DAO classes:

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/moviedb", "root", "password");

4. Compile and Run:

javac org/anudip/main/Main.java
java org.anudip.main.Main

🧑‍💻 Usage / Running the Application:
-----------------------------------
Once you run the program, you’ll see:

Welcome to Movie Ticket Booking (Console Demo)
1) List Movies
2) View Shows for Movie
3) Exit
Choose:1

Example Flow:
--------------
1. Select 1 → Lists all movies.


2. Select a movie ID → Lists showtimes.


3. Select a showtime → Displays available seats.


4. Choose a seat and enter your name → Confirms booking.




---

🧪 Running Tests:
------------------

✓ You can manually test by:

✓ Booking the same seat twice (should show “Booking failed”).

✓ Checking different show IDs and seat IDs.

✓ Verifying data in the database (bookings table updates correctly).



---

🌐 Deployment:
--------------
This is a console-based project, so no web deployment is needed.
However, it can later be:

Extended into a web app using JSP/Servlets or Spring Boot.

Deployed on a Tomcat server with a web interface.



---

🛠️ Build With:
--------------
✓ Java SE 8+

✓ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

✓ MySQL / PostgreSQL

✓ DAO Design Pattern

✓ Scanner (for console input)



---

🏁 Conclusion:
---------------
The Movie Ticket Booking System demonstrates a simple but powerful use of Java and JDBC for real-world database-driven applications.
It helps beginners understand:

Data access layers using DAO pattern.

CRUD operations via JDBC.

Command-line interaction with database-backed logic.
